# E-commerce Customer Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior from an e-commerce dataset to uncover revenue patterns, customer churn, and high-value customer segments. The goal is to translate raw transaction data into actionable business insights using Python.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze overall sales and revenue trends  
- Identify top customers by revenue and purchase frequency  
- Measure customer churn based on inactivity  
- Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
- Provide business-driven insights and recommendations  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (WSL)  

---

##  Dataset
- UK-based online retail transaction dataset  
- Contains invoices, product details, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries  

---

##  Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Revenue Analysis
- Calculated total revenue and number of transactions  
- Analyzed country-wise revenue contribution  

### 2. Customer Analysis
- Identified top 10 customers by total revenue  
- Analyzed most frequent customers based on number of purchases  

### 3. Customer Churn Analysis
- Defined churn as customers inactive for more than 90 days  
- Calculated churn rate and visualized churn distribution  

### 4. RFM Analysis
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency**: Number of unique purchases  
- **Monetary**: Total spend by customer  
- Segmented customers into groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, At-risk Customers, and Lost Customers  

---

##  Business Insights

- A small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total revenue, indicating strong revenue concentration.
- A significant portion of customers have churned based on a 90-day inactivity threshold.
- Customer purchasing behavior varies: some customers buy frequently with lower spend, while others buy less often but spend more.
- The United Kingdom dominates overall revenue, while other countries show potential for growth.
- RFM segmentation clearly identifies high-value customers (Champions) and churn-prone customers (At-risk and Lost).

---

##  Recommendations

- Introduce loyalty programs or exclusive benefits for high-value (Champion and Loyal) customers to reduce churn.
- Re-engage churned and at-risk customers through personalized offers or targeted email campaigns.
- Encourage repeat purchases by offering bundled products or discounts.
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions while testing growth strategies in underperforming markets.
